This is my training of algorithm like data structure, search, sort, and so on.
Languages are C and C++.


--- Compare "insertion sort" "bubble sort" "selection sort" ---

1. Calculation speed of "insertion sort" depends on data's alignment but of others don't.
2. All of three sorts, alculation order is O(N**2).
3. "insertion sort" and "bubble sort" is stable, but "selection sort" is not.
   (Stable means that if the array has same numbers, they cannot be exchanged by sort.)


If I notice something later, I will renew README.
